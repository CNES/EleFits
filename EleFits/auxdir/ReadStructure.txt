Read the main properties of each HDU, and optionally some keyword records.

Usage: 
  EleFitsReadStructure <input> [-K [<filter>]] [-C [<count>]]

<input> is the path to the input file.

Option -K (or --keywords) allows filtering the records.
- Omitting -K, records are not read at all.
- Using -K with no argument, all the records are read.
- Using -K <filter>, only records of specified categories are read.

Option -C (or --columns) sets the maximum number of displayed column names.
- Omitting -C, columns are not displayed at all.
- Using -C with no argument, all columns are displayed.
- Using -C <count>, only the first <count> columns are displayed, followed by "...".

The following character flags are used:
- m for Mandatory records (aka Required, e.g. NAXIS),
- r for Reserved records (e.g. EXPTIME),
- c for Comment records (COMMENT or HISTORY),
- u for User records (all other records).

For example:
- Read HDU properties:
    EleFitsReadStructure input.fits
- Read HDU properties and all records
    EleFitsReadStructure input.fits -K
- Read HDU properties and Required and User records
    EleFitsReadStructure input.fits -K ru
