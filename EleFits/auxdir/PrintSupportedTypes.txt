For each data structure (Record, Raster, Column), this program
prints the list of types supported by EleFits.

Record values are stored as ASCII strings in the Fits file.
Machine types (short, int, long...) are therefore adequate.

In contrast, Raster and Column data are stored in binary format.
It is therefore preferrable to stick to fixed-length integers instead
(std::int16_t, std::int32_t, std::int64_t...) to ensure that no useless
and possibly lossy conversions and copies are performed.
