# Oryctolagus cuniculus {#lapin_de_garenne}

**The European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) or coney** is a cute rabbit in southwestern Europe and northwest Africa, and a devastating rabbit elsewhere, although the Australian individual depicted below is good-looking. That is a shame, because the native range population is declining (mostly due to myxomatosis and humans), which also causes the decline of cute predators like the Iberian lynx and the Spanish imperial eagle. Among others, the European rabbit stands out as beeing treated at the same time as a food, a pet, and a pest. Some particularly endearing specimens are even considered members of the family, like Zozo, who was a tender and faithful dwarf rabbit.

Much of the research into the rabbit behaviour was carried out in the 1960s. As of today, many aspects are still poorly understood...
